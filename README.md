# Project-4

This is the final project for the UCI Data Analytics Bootcamp Course.

Building off of our 3rd project that generated a map of Hawaii and drew layers for parking structures, hotels, and popular hiking trails, this project focuses on showing what we have learned since then. These skills include building a machine learning algorithm that predicts airline airfares through linear regression, newly recorded COVID-19 cases used to predict the chance of death, and Tableau visualizations of weather information.

Data for this project was collected from sources such as the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Department of Transportation (DoT), and OpenWeather API. They can be found here:
