# Project-4

This is the final project for the UCI Data Analytics Bootcamp Course.

Building off of our 3rd project that generated a map of Hawaii and drew layers for parking structures, hotels, and popular hiking trails, this project focuses on showing what we have learned since then. These skills include building a machine learning algorithm that predicts airline airfares through linear regression, newly recorded COVID-19 cases used to predict the chance of death, and Tableau visualizations of weather information.
